//The JavaScript string valueOf() method is used to find out the primitive value of String object. This method is invoked by JavaScript automatically. Thus, there is no requirement to call it explicitly in the code.

//Here, we will print the primitive value of string object.


var str="Javatpoint";  
console.log(str.valueOf());  




//Let's see one more example to print the primitive value of string object.


var str1=new String("Javatpoint");  
console.log(str1.valueOf());
