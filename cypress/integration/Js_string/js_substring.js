//The JavaScript string substring() method fetch the string on the basis of provided index and returns the new sub string. It works similar to the slice() method with a difference that it doesn't accepts negative indexes. This method doesn't make any change in the original string


//Let's see a simple example to print the part of the string.


var str="Javatpoint";  
console.log(str.substring(0,4));  




//In this example, we will fetch single character from the string.


var str1="Javatpoint";  
console.log(str1.substring(4,5));  



//In this example, we will provide only the starting index.

var str2="Javatpoint";  
console.log(str2.substring(5));  





//In this example, we will not pass any parameter with the method. In such case, the method returns the complete string.
var str3="Javatpoint";  
console.log(str3.substring());
