JavaScript Inheritance
The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. 
//It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

The JavaScript a child class extends keyword is used to create on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child 
//class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

Points to remember
It maintains an IS-A relationship.
The extends keyword is used in class expressions or class declarations.
Using extends keyword, we can acquire all the properties and behavior of the inbuilt object as well as custom classes.
We can also use a prototype-based approach to achieve inheritance.
