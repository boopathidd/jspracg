//In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. We can define the class just like function 
declarations and function expressions.

//The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including methods or constructor. 
//The class is executed in strict mode. 
//So, the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.

The class syntax contains two components:

Class declarations
Class expressions
