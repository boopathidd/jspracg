//Being a scripting language, sometimes the JavaScript code displays the correct result even it has some errors. To overcome this problem we can use the JavaScript strict mode.

//The JavaScript provides "use strict"; expression to enable the strict mode. If there is any silent error or mistake in the code, it throws an error.
//Note - The "use strict"; expression can only be placed as the first statement in a script or in a function.

//Let's see the example without using strict mode.

x=10;  
console.log(x);
