JavaScript return
The return statement is used to return a particular value from the function to the function caller. The function will stop executing when the return statement is called. The return statement should be the last statement in a function because the code after the return statement will be unreachable.

We can return primitive values (such as Boolean, number, string, etc.) and Object types (such as functions, objects, arrays, etc.) by using the return statement.

We can also return multiple values using the return statement. It cannot be done directly. We have to use an Array or Object to return multiple values from a function.
